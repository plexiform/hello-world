He saw a man who arrived in the United States with nothing, who had lost a child, who was being pilloried in the press by reporters and his ex-wife and who verged on having his life’s work destroyed. “He has the ability to work harder and endure more stress than anyone I’ve ever met,” Gracias said. “What he went through in 2008 would have broken anyone else. He didn’t just survive. He kept working and stayed focused.” That ability to stay focused in the midst of a crisis stands as one of Musk’s main advantages over other executives and competitors. “Most people who are under that sort of pressure fray,” Gracias said. “Their decisions go bad. Elon gets hyperrational. He’s still able to make very clear, long-term decisions. The harder it gets, the better he gets. Anyone who saw what he went through firsthand came away with more respect for the guy. I’ve just never seen anything like his ability to take pain.”</h3>\n<hr/>\n\"you're choosing to be the equivalent of Special Forces\"\n<hr/>\n\"Failure is not a stigma.

They don’t come out of great disruptive moments that break forth from an otherwise ordinary, drab life. They are part and parcel of how we live our every day; all moments can be creative and spontaneous when we experience the entire world as an open and expansive place. We get there by constantly cultivating our ability to imagine transcending our own experience.” - puett, the path\n<hr/>\n“There is no ethical or moral framework that transcends context and the complexity of human life. All we have is the messy world within which to work and better ourselves. These ordinary as-if rituals are the means by which we imagine new realities over time construct new worlds. Our lives begin in the everyday and stay in the everyday. Only in the everyday can we begin to create truly great worlds.” - path\n<hr/>\n“People’s beliefs about their abilities have a profound effect on those abilities.”\n― Albert Bandura\n<hr/>\n“The human mind is generative, creative, proactive, and reflective -- not just reactive.”\n― Albert Bandura\n<hr/>\n“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself — and you are the easiest person to fool.”\n<hr/>\nBe not afraid of growing slowly, be afraid only of standing still.\n<hr/>\n  the agile mind quotes, wilma koutstaal [link: https://minds-brains-environments.com/home/]\n<hr/>\nmichael i. jordan\n<hr/>\n[make quotes page]\n  <div style={{marginTop:48}}>\n    <div style={{display: 'inline-block'}}>\n      <h1><a href=\"https://dribbble.com/excursos\">dribbble</a></h1>\n      <h1><a href=\"https://github.com/plexiform\">github</a></h1>\n      <h1><a href=\"\">twitter</a></h1>\n    </div>\n\n\n  </div>\n  </Layout>\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  {\n    allFile {\n      edges {\n        node {\n          base\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
