Tonight, I saw my mother trying so hard to hold her tears back. The image springs unbidden into my thoughts and tugs at my heart. I know how tough it's been for her, how impossible it must feel to crave -- demand -- respect from someone as vainglorious as my father. He's the sort of man caught up in former wins over "lesser" people, from days before any of us entered the picture. It doesn't take much to be lesser in his eyes. 

I've never once heard an unqualified apology from him, to anyone, let alone the word "sorry" at all, qualified or otherwise. Not for the myriad abuses he piled and continues to pile on us. Not for the gaslighting, the externalizing of blame. Blaming us as young teenagers for our adolescent pangs interfering with his business. Blaming my mother for not enthroning him in her eyes. He's never apologized for the blatant breaches of boundaries, for dismissing people as less-than. Should someone fail to piece into his myopic worldview, his rage and ire metabolizes into fullblown resentment. Any retaliation is met with condemnation. The sort of man to threaten for respect, to belittle and call his own daughter a bitch. To wish her beheaded and pretend that it not being a possibility somehow makes it a joke.

In a very real sense I feel guilty. I want to be able to provide for my mother, to secure a means for her escape. I think about how I might have contributed to her stress. I think of my own selfishness and of how difficult it is for me to even hug her due to my own issues. Yet while she is a victim of his narcissism, she hasn't cowed. She's kept her self-respect through it all. She sees my father for what he is. Her immediate family loves and cares for her. I'm proud of her.

I just don't like the idea that, since all of our time here is limited, that anyone should wear the expression my mother did tonight.

The best that I can do is to do the best for myself. I'll bring her what happiness I can. She is loved -- I love her, and I want her to know that; the best way is through success.
