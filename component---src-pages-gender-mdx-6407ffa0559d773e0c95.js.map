preferences:##`}</p>\n    <p>{`The unitary model describes a situation in which decisions are made as, by, or for a unit, such as parents deciding for their children, and that the family's utility is modeled as an individual's.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A dictatorial model is unitary. However, it doesn't mean the dictator doesn't take others' preferences into account.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Another unitary model is where everyone has the same preferences. This is known as the unanimity model.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Usually in families, a more game theoretic scenario is likely. People reaching a stasis since they'll react to each other's decisions. With sufficiently skilled negotiators, this can be efficient.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So how do we test the unitary model?`}</p>\n    <p>{`A unitary model depends only on goods' prices, individual utilities, and the household's aggregate income. In a non-unitary model, a household also considers individuals' incomes. This is because their income influences their bargaining power. They're competing. People's bargaining power within a household will be represented as weights. Other determinants of bargaining power include age, gender, and the institutions in place. These influence bargainers' outside option, or what'll happen if they choose to leave the household.`}</p>\n    <p>{`To speak of unitary households in more intuitive terms, we can say that, to start with, people's individual preferences aren't in contest with household purchasing decisions. Either everyone is on the same page (yay, the hivemind gets what it wants), or some people voicing their preferences makes little difference (father knows best).`}</p>\n    <p>{`We can test whether or not a household is unitary by observing changes in things that'd normally affect bargaining power, without changing preferences. The latter condition would preclude factors such as education, since they may affect preferences. The reason we don't want to change preferences is that those factor into `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`both`}</em>{` unitary and non-unitary models, so if someone's preferences change, we wouldn't be able to tell the changes in household purchasing from if someone's bargaining power changed. However, if we just pick something that changes someone's bargaining power and not their preferences, we know that someone is \"pushing against\" the other people in the household and therefore it's non-unitary.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An example of this is changes in divorce laws for Muslim women, which stripped those women of bargaining power. Another example is South African pension reform.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After Apartheid, there were pension reforms. It was decided that black people would receive pensions on par with white people -- pensions that were roughly double the median income for people in the area. There were many inter-generational households with grandparents rearing their grandchildren. This is because the children's parents either suffered from and died from HIV/AIDS, or they had to move away. Esther Duflo wanted to see how a grandparents receiving pensions affected the height-weight ratio of their grandchildren, i.e. how well they're being fed and taken care of. `}</p>\n    <p>{`She found that eligible households `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`did`}</em>{` have better outcomes for their children, but this result didn't tell the whole story. When a man received the pension, outcomes for girls weren't affected. It was only when grandmothers received the pension that their granddaughters showed `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`significant`}</em>{` improvements with a better \"z-score.\" When someone else measured returns to labor supply instead of the hgith-weight ratio, they found that the mother's mother passed down the money to the granddaughter, but the father's mother's side did no such thing (on average). Reasons uncertain. Maybe the father's mother passed it down to the father, and he kept it.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This reveals non-unitary households.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We're also interested in efficiency, or how \"optimized\" everyone's utility is, unitary household or not. Efficiency is best realized by first earning as much money as possible for the household, then choosing how to distribute that. When Chris Udry[] examined houses in Burkina Faso, he found that too many inputs were allocated to male plots as opposed to female plots than would be optimal. Taking all inputs' production functions, he estimated that optimizing the plots would have afforded them 13% more income.`}</p>\n    <p>{`refer back to `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\":
