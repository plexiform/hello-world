He used the British Black Plague as an example, in particular that people's wages went up afterwards. However, the Malthusian theory doesn't account for innovation. People may feel compelled to innovate under pressure. The Green Revolution was a response to population growth and limited food resources.`}</p>\n    <p>{`[family 1]`}{` Increased bargaining power for women affects number of children.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We're interested in whether family size affects its children's well-being. If we just look at welfare versus family size, we don't know which way the causation goes. Does family size make a family poorer off, or does a family with \"poor/'low quality' preferences\" choose to have more kids?`}</p>\n    <p>{`Becker Quality/quantity tradeoff means that larger families are that way by choice. This tradeoff is predicated on the idea that more kids = less resources and less love and less attention to go around.`}</p>\n    <p>{`According to this model, a family's utility can be gleaned by how large the family is. If we observe just the effect of family growth on welfare, we don't know if this is a function of size or of parental preferences. Imagine that we force a family to have fewer kids. They might still have \"low quality\" children, simply because that's their preference. They don't `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`feel`}</em>{` like providing a good education or healthcare. These people might choose to have more kids as a result of that, since they can afford to.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The model also argues that as people grow richer, they'll want higher quality children. This is because they treat `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`quality`}</em>{` as a normal good. If they want higher quality as their income increases, they'll be willing to spend more on quality, and as a result have fewer children.`}</p>\n    <p>{`How do we test this model?`}</p>\n    <p>{`If you exogenously vary their family size, presumably parental preferences would remained unchanged. Therefore we can directly observe the effect of family size on welfare.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So we want to observe mismatches between people's utility and what happens, whether by accident of birth or policies. If a family has one utility and they accidentally have more kids than they'd intended, we can observe differences in outcomes between this family and some other family that has the amount of kids intended. This way we can determine if family size affects children's welfare.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The way we'll be determining this is by looking at families that already have 1 child and are planning to have a second. If the second is twins, we have our unexpected event.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We're not observing just twins with just single kid families, since twins are more likely to be weaker and less nourished at baseline than a single kid, as they split resources in the womb.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Evidence: Josh Angrist, Victor Lavy, Analia Schlosser; Israel twins accounting for gender differences; Israeli Arabs are poor, and we observe them; no effect of family size on welfare found. One argument against this result is that even poor Israelis have access to good education and healthcare.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's look to another study.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Nancy Qian (tea person) : depending on where you are, the one-child policy is either still strictly in place or has been relaxed. Girls in relaxed areas will likely have another sibling and thus larger family. Boys in relaxed areas...small family size. Girls in non-relaxed areas, small family size.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Girls in relaxed policy regions, and therefore in larger families, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`gained`}</em>{` education. The gap between their smaller-family counterparts was larger than the gap between relaxed and non-relaxed boys' education. Boys' education, meanwhile, stayed largely the same.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There are a few things to consider in our analysis here.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We don't know if having one additional baby by mistake is enough to make a difference. Maybe after another threshold things change.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We also don't know if having a girl first means that girl is being benefited from some spillover effect of having another kid. If this is the case, then it would mean there isn't much of a trade-off w/ quality and quantity and instead they boost each other.`}</p>\n    <p>{`There may be some bias because families who keep their firstborn/girl and have another kid would take better care of their kid anyway, relative to others who off their firstborn. This would be especially relevant if people had a girl they kept and `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`then`}</em>{` the policy was relaxed, so they had another.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Taking the findings at face value — in Israel, no decrease in welfare with family size; in China, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`increased`}</em>{` welfare for girls — seem to refute Becker and Tommes's quality-quantity tradeoff.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In both of the studies mentioned above, a counterpoint to their results is that, well, so you went up by 1 kid, so what? Maybe we observe these quantity-quality tradeoffs at a higher threshold. Cue the RAND study.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In the 1970's, ICDDR'B introduce in Matlab increased access to contraceptives and community workers who make regular visits (very active women, significant contributors). In 1996, RAND did an extensive survey of the area. Family size in the treatment area went down by 1.2. If the average family size was 5, it went down to 4. No difference in quality of children. Eventually birth rates in treatment and control areas converged, as birth rates were decreasing anyway`}</p>\n    <p>{`Our conclusion here is consistent with the others. This is one of the main takeaways that flies in the face of common wisdom.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The other re: people \"can't figure it out for themselves\" argument:`}</p>\n    <p>{`Contraception young doctor in Colombia and Grant Miller from Stanford, evaluation: contraception significantly significant but ultimately a small effect. Same as in Matlab, in which contraception may not have done too much. So it's not that people don't know how to use birth control, but rather, their reasons for having children are important.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We see a contagion-like curve in contraception take-up. Viruses' growth trajectory take on something like an S-shape curve.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We want to know, how much of this is because of intra-community effects, people talking to each other, or due to some other reason, such as increased supply meeting `}{`[an initially constrained]`}{` demand, or the quality of the community health worker assigned to a village.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Kaivan Munshi investigates this by observing 2 groups: the Bengali and Muslim communities. Both communities are assigned one community health worker between them. Therefore, if contraception use is spreading due to that health worker as opposed to social norms, we should find a shared effect. Otherwise we can attribute takeup to social norms/community effects. They find no correlation in uptake between the two groups, meaning it was social effects and not the community worker responsible for changes in contraception.`}</p>\n    <p>{`An example of changing social norms and family preferences:`}</p>\n    <p>{`Telenovelas, Rede Globo, fertility decreasing already, but families adopt more nuclear models, name kids after telenovela actors; changes observed in younger folks (possibly b/c their views were molded by the shows, but also possibly b/c fertility less likely anyway post-35); areas that received the Telenovelas earlier dropped in fertility at around the same time`}</p>\n    <p>{`Duflo, Dupas, Kremer in Kenya:\n(d)`}{`[https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/preventing-hiv-and-teen-pregnancy-kenya-roles-teacher-training-and-education-subsidies]`}</p>\n    <p>{`Backdrop/context: kids in Kenya taught ABCD — Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms, or Die. This is to combat both teenage pregnancy and spread of STD's. However, condom usage is stigmatized and censored due to religious doctrine. Kids don't wish to abstain nor to die, so they get married young. This interrupts their schooling as well as their household status.`}</p>\n    <p>{`2002-2003, 376 schools, 4 groups: free uniforms, teacher training, both uniform and teacher training, and control.`}</p>\n    <p>{`They find that free uniforms increased the probability of completing school by the most, and the \"both\" group outdid the \"teacher training\" group. However, \"both\" had a lower probability than `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`just`}</em>{` the uniform group. This suggests that teacher training undoes some effect of free uniforms on school completion. However, teacher training does fare better than the control group.`}</p>\n    <p>{`We find analogous results on pregnancy rates. The uniform group had the lowest probability of getting pregnant, the \"both\" group had higher prob. than the uniform group, but a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`lower`}</em>{` probability than the teacher group. However, teacher training has `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`higher`}</em>{` rates of pregnancy than the control group.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Neither teacher training nor uniforms help with the already high HSV2 rates. However, \"both\" reduces rates of HSV2. Why? If it was just teacher training, students might switch from casual sex to married sex, but STD rates might be every bit as high because of promiscuous sugar daddies. If it was just uniforms, school is cheaper, so pregnancy is off the table, but casual sex isn't. If it's both teacher training and uniforms, we don't want casual sex nor married sex. STD's go down.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The evidence presented above suggests against the hypothesis that larger families invest less in human capital, and also against the hypothesis that poor people are too dumb to know how contraception works or how to get it. They should have access to contraception just in case, but generally people know what they're doing. We also observed what influences people's attitudes towards family planning, whether it be social norms, cost of schooling, or telenovelas. What else?`}</p>\n    <p>{`As with family dynamics in post-Apartheid South Africa or farmers in Burkina Faso, bargaining power matters here. `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"/gender\"\n      }}>{`Who are the decision makers?`}</a></p>\n    <p>{`In addition to the examples listed in that link, we can observe the effect of private information on family planning. In Zambia, women want fewer children than men do. In Lusaka, 836 women were given vouchers to meet with family planning nurses, with one caveat. They were randomly assigned to either meet the nurse in private, or with their husband. If they received it in private, 38% more asked for concealed (e.g. injectable) contraceptives, and reported 57% fewer unwanted pregnancies in the next year (9-14 months). This promptly changed for the worse up when Zambian policy removed injectable contraceptives from the market. 23% more women redeemed the voucher if they received it in private. Yet more evidence against the unitary hypothesis.`}</p>\n    <p><a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/contraceptive-adoption-fertility-and-family-zambia\"\n      }}>{`https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/contraceptive-adoption-fertility-and-family-zambia`}</a></p>\n    <p>{`A couple of illuminating examples reveal more of the picture.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Nancy Qian et al? observed that families who had children after the one-child policy accumulated 10% more savings than their pre-policy counterparts. Treatment families in the Matlab family-planning program accrued $3,600 PPP USD more in savings. This suggests that people substitute children for savings. We can imagine that this is influenced in large part by social norms. If parents invest more heavily in boys, it's because they expect more out of that investment. If they invest less in girls because of the cost of dowries or of them switching families, we can expect to see this reflected in how much less money their girl sends them in older age. However, as seen in the tea-orchard example, or in the case of proximal villages getting a boost in average income and thus raising girls' values (since they marry into these villages), myriad factors influence where parental investments go.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Since some who women who receive financial windfalls are more likely to invest in their children and households, as shown with post-Apartheid pension policy, this could make them better targets for subsidies. On the contrary, if it's less aa windfall and more a \"I did this,\" they might keep the money for themselves or invest it into their businesses. Maybe this explains microcredit's insignificant effect on women's empowerment at first brush?`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
