Once we understand the scope of a study, we can define our range of options. Budgets and timelines are also necessary to account for.</p>\n<p>What's the plan? Will we conduct the surveys ourselves or outsource it to some other team? How will people respond to your wanting to run the study, in that context? Which permits are necessary? IRBs accounted for?</p>\n<p>Once we're there, what are the logistics for the people involved? How will they travel and eat? How will they take care of their equipment? Do they have directions, and might they run into local holidays?</p>\n<p>When working with data, how's the internet there? Where are you placing your data?</p>\n<p>It's important to consider team structure and what are the layers of accountability, quality management, and monitoring. You can have people who make sure people are sent where they're sent, that the people who are sent are monitoring field operations and managing logistics to ensure high quality, that team managers get the support they need, etc. Then there are people who make sure the data collected is up to par and cleaned up, etc.</p>\n<p>How do we recruit a field team?</p>\n<p>We want to be clear about our project's goals and requirements. What are we about? How much manpower do we need for our team's needs, like the sample size required and budget?</p>\n<p>It's possible when we outsource and advertise in a local context, we have to watch out for potential cons. We want to weed out this risk. When we do hire, we want to make pay and schedule crystal clear. When we do have applicants, we want to make sure that we have a good process to narrow the pool down.</p>\n<p>The screening process involves examining applicants' credentials and CV's, then testing them. Testing can take a number of forms, such as verbal aptitude tests, roleplay tests, situational judgment tests, etc. We also make sure that potential hires are versed in basic skills such as budget management and mathematical knowhow. Generally we want to train and hire more than we need to account for attrition.</p>\n<p>It's important that candidates understand what is being asked of them as well as any confidentiality considerations.</p>\n<p>How do we train our team?</p>\n<p>A survey manual should parallel the questionnaire. It should plan for all contingencies.</p>\n<p>We want to accommodate trainees during their training. Compensate them for the opportunity cost of not working, supply food, and provide a location.</p>\n<p>Don't forget the social component! People ought to be getting along. When we train a leader, it helps for them to be trained alongside everyone else, though of course they made require additional training outside of that.</p>\n<p>It's critical as ever to remember that human subjects considerations should always be kept in mind. Does everyone understand their roles?  When we deal with people, are our surveyors aware of the consent process?</p>\n<p>Now we get around to learning the survey instrument. People ought to read aloud and understand the questionnaire and points to be emphasized therein. Be sure to cross-reference the survey manual all the while!</p>\n<p>When we interview people, there can be a bit of a trade-off between clearly delineated questions asked verbatim, whose upside is speed and reduction of \"noisy\" signals that put us at risk of some bias. However, adopting a conversational tone can help get to the truth of the matter when interviewing a respondent, and can allow for more clarity when dealing with, say, scaled questions. One downside of a conversational approach is that we may introduce surveyor effects or bias, meaning now we're bringing our own interpretations and chance of confusion when interpreting or influencing someone's answer.</p>\n<p>We want to make sure surveyors are comfortable with any requisite equipment.</p>\n<p>How will they record and measure data? Do they know how to work the GPS?</p>\n<p>How safe are they and the equipment they carry? Where will equipment be stored? Are we in adherence with local dress codes? It's also important that we are cognizant of and prepared to handle sexual harassment.</p>\n<p>How do we manage our team's productivity?</p>\n<p>We want to set clear performance goals. It's paramount that we emphasize quality over efficiency. Rules and schedules ought to be clear and strictly enforced. Catch falsification of data! We have to be ready to fire people who breach confidentiality or make up data.</p>\n<p>When defining our expectations, we should take logistics and factors such as travel time, time needed to survey, etc. into account. It can also be difficult to find respondents! This can be influenced by a number of things. People may be at a local festival, or aggregated by farms during a heavy agricultural season. When setting our average survey hour expectations, we want to consider the average time over some course of time.</p>\n<p>How do we keep them motivated?</p>\n<p>Money is one way. Pay them on time, and preferably don't pay them by survey, as this can be a stressful \"negative\" form of motivation. Define the metrics by which they'll get paid clearly. We can award bonuses as well.</p>\n<p>Career incentives - promotions and the like.</p>\n<p>Be involved! Interpersonal skills are key, and have a strong moral compass.</p>\n<p>What if we outsource our work?</p>\n<p>We can hire a survey company. We can also have our own people collaborate with others.</p>\n<p>A company can take care of logistics that would otherwise be difficult for outside surveyors. It also likely has established HR.</p>\n<p>The tradeoff is that companies will generally have worse survey quality. They're usually accustomed to conducting different types of research, such as market reesarch, than what we're looking for. This also incurs costs on us, as we need to monitor that very quality. Negotiating can be a hassle.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Human Resources - Survey Team","tags":["rct_design"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/human-resources/"}}}
