Have 1/20/2020 be Habit 5 (2)</h3>\n<p>Here I'll evaluate and recalibrate my approach over the last 5 days. The goal is to work up to 8 hours a day, ramping up an hour or so every 3 days. However, I hadn't met my \"habit shaping\" quora on some days. Because I'm trying to create lifelong habits of self-love and self-discipline, it would be counterproductive to beat myself up over my lapses, so I will instead step back and look at what I've logged as \"rooms for improvement\" over the last couple of days. Then I'll make them actionable.</p>\n<p>Battle plan:\n- \"Leave rest to fate\" and outcome-detachment ritual\n- bolstered by self-forgiveness and self-compassion\n- self-talk: \"have to\" -> \"get to\"; \"should\"s into \"would\"s\n- reality-test fears - worst case scenario plotting\n- log decisions and potential improvements column\n- use the latter two points to free myself to exercise great optimism\nand positivity\n- use studies as \"research\" into alternate fantasy world (e.g. economics as\nmagical arcane arts)\n- Set Freedom app blocking hours on phone\n- Set time block on lunch breaks</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Regroup!","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/regroup/"}}}
