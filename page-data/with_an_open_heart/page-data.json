I've been eminently unproductive over the last couple of days. I've filled in my Beeminder learning hours as \"recalibration\" despite that. While my automatic reaction to having done so, effectively \"cheating\" my system, says I'm being disingenuous, I'll provide a couple of reasons my gut (and brain) disagree, and why I stand by the decision. First, going overboard on long-term binding contracts such as Beeminder can actually work <i>against</i> the goal itself, stirring resentment. These binding contracts are typically best confined to smaller, repeatable, and non-sustained goals (salads before meals, sitting down at a certain time, etc) -- not 8 hours of concentrated work per day. My first defense, therefore, is \"don't be ridiculous.\" My work ethic has improved considerably and I intend to celebrate it as such.</p>\n<p>Second, however, is that this is an opportunity for me to step back and evaluate and recalibrate.</p>\n<p>Over the last day or two, as dates draw nearer and my confidence falters, it's critical that I reprimand my fears head-on, remind myself of the principles and identity I swear to, and remember who I'm doing this for. I will adhere to my binding contracts while minimizing events such as this to my utmost -- and the comments on my entered data will speak to that.</p>\n<p>It's for y'all. I know, right now no one is likely to be reading this blog, but I will be the example that people can look up to and emulate. What did ASDP do when he felt squeezed?</p>\n<p>-- see \"principles\"</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"With an Open Heart","tags":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/with_an_open_heart/"}}}
