It seems this note-taking system is better suited for items more open to interpretation than in mathematics, where you take a set of axioms and reason up from there. Why is that? If my framework for building \"humanistic\" knowledge is jumping from A to B to Z, it becomes a question of what's in the \"to's.\" The difficulty arises in qualifying those \"to's,\" shifting and malleable depending on the presence and interpretation of information.</p>\n<p><em>If</em> we assume philosophy or some similarly \"humanistic\" undertaking can be pursued on similar principles as in mathematics, that there are basic truths from which we can reason up, a lot of the arguing would come from disagreements on the axioms we accept or in how we follow them.</p>\n<p>I'll note that \"philosophy of everyday life\" doesn't fall into the purview of this convo. The word \"philosophy\" in that context is more a prescription for life than an open-ended inquiry to the nature of existence or knowledge or whatever. I've heard it said that Eastern philosophy is more practical than Western, and will address that distinction elsewhere.</p>\n<p>There's a dogma against philosophy given the successes of science. While many who hold this dogma are quick to acknowledge the role philosophy had in producing  various scientific fields, their acknowledgement falls well short of ebullience. They posit that the practicality of falsification outranks philosophy and its lack of evidence.</p>\n<p>So how do we define philosophy (since this is a freestyle post, I've totally gone off the hard-vs-soft argument for the time being)? If we take it to be gestalt knowledge from which everything derives, it'd be kinda boring. So, I'm gonna cut out \"natural/physical philosophy\" from this conversation, taking for granted that the philosophy I'm interested in deals with the fuzzy and hard-to-define questions. This leads naturally to \"stuff that's <del>hard</del> impossible? empirically observe.\" Going further, I want to stop short of navel-gazing and actually find something useful here.</p>\n<p>One meta example of the usefulness of philosophy is that practicing philosophy or following the arguments of philosophers could train reasoning skills. Even if you're navel-gazing, if you're able to make compelling and logically-consistent arguments, that's something. The mental calisthenics of argument and deduction, induction, contradiction, and all the rest of it would presumably be useful in dissecting lines of reasoning in unrelated fields, provided you recognize the patterns.</p>\n<p>Taking this meta example a step further, philosophy can construct different viewpoints to shift between and synthesize and therefore inspire innovation. This would be the mental equivalent of having some arbitrary set of lines on a sheet of paper as opposed to a blank canvas, thereby increasing creativity under constraints or suggestion.</p>\n<p>Another example is that, since every field of knowledge presumably has some fuzzy edge and an element of the unknown, the questions we ask in order to take those fields further are philosophical. How, after all, do we decide where to go? When we're at a crossroads, and all roads seem equally fruitless, what guides us? Will experience be useful when we're dealing with areas whose laws are completely alien to us? Philosophy will therefore be front-and-center in areas such as cognitive science.</p>\n<p>In engineering, you have some mechanism whose pieces operate upon each other in a set manner. This here lever flips that there switch. How you <em>use</em> that mechanism might be open to interpretation. Taking it a step further, how you <em>should use</em> said mechanism seems philosophical. Ethics and stuff.</p>\n<p>Perhaps philosophy then is useful as a tool for building frameworks that we build empiricism in.</p>\n<p><b><i>If I want to understand purpose and beauty, there's fertile ground in people's thinking. I can then translate this into empirical studies.</i></b></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Soft vs. Hard Knowledge","tags":["musings"]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/hard_and_soft/"}}}
